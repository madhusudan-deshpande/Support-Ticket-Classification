# Automatic Support Ticket Classification using NLP

* Support Ticket is a document that records interactions between a customer and a customer support team.
* When a customer submits a query, a ticket is created and shared between the customer and the support representatives
* Service representatives interact with customers by responding to support tickets. When the issue is resolved, the ticket is closed
* The aim of this project is to build a classification model that can appropriate label the incoming support tickets using their text content
* This project demonstrates use of various NLP such text data cleaning, data visualization, sampling and various machine learning models
